        <p>
          Hey there! I am excited to bring you programming posts{" "}
          <strong>for your programming languages</strong>. However, I've hit my
          current Supabase Free Plan usage limit, and if I do get the money, I
          will upgrade to the Pro Plan to deliver more content.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a screenshot of the notification I received from Supabase:</p>
